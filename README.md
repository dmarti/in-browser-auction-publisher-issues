Summary and links to web publisher considerations for in-browser ad placements


# Introduction

A significant number of issues have been raised about how to make
TURTLEDOVE (and other related bird-themed proposals for in-browser ad
auctions) work for marketers, but little has been discussed about how
this can work for publishers. We have identified a number of potential
issues in TURTLEDOVE that would have a significant negative impact on
publishers\' businesses unless they were resolved.

This document covers ad placement. We plan to create a
similar document around reporting issues from the Privacy Sandbox
proposals and how they impact publishers\' businesses. 

These issues also present problems for users, who are likely to
experience problems with exposure to malware or otherwise harmful or
undesirable ads, and a lower-quality experience as more ads are able to
game the system and fail to support high-engagement publisher
properties.

This document refers to a "web property" and not a site, to recognize
that the set of locations with common data stewardship and advertising
management may not necessarily be a "site" as defined in web standards.
A web property may span multiple subdomains, registerable domains and
schemas. (We suggest the use of this term as we agree with [a recent
suggestion that the distinctions among the terms "first party" and
"third party" are not easily understood by web users and developers](https://tess.oconnor.cx/2020/10/parties).)

# Existing related issues

We will update this document with links to relevant issues.  Two general issues
that have raised related points are:

 * [Capabilities of the proposal for publishers 路 Issue #51 路 WICG/turtledove](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/51)

 * [TurtleDove: Ambiguity in level of decision making. 路 Issue #73 路 WICG/turtledove](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/73)


# Publisher use cases

 * [Ad placement use cases](placement.md)

 * [Ad reporting use cases](reporting.md)

## Conclusion: why we believe these needs are necessary for a viable replacement to existing cross-publisher IDs

The goal of improving advertising must ensure publishers are not
negatively impacted by new W3C standards as this would have a negative
impact on the availability, diversity, quality or publisher web content
and services. If browser APIs interferes or disproportionately impacts
publisher ability to compete against larger rivals, then web
publishers are likely to avoid support for in-browser ad placement
proposals.
